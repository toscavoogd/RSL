When I first saw this in the theater I was totally put off by the cinematography of the second half of the film. After repeated watching I think it is actually masterfully constructed. Empty. The only part of the film that still fails, in my opinion, is the section dealing with the news interviews of the soldiers. Meant to revolt us ... they simply come across as dry and excessive. So far removed from the Jungles of platoon this movies depiction of the shells of destroyed Vietnamese cities is amazing. ... Oh yeah ... and if since I have not stated it earlier I will say this ... the first half of this movie is nothing short of ingenious. Utterly amazing.
